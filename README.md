# OGOP-Time-Distance-Calculator
For Newton’s equations of motion with constant acceleration, given 3 of 5 variables (V,U,A,T,S), this calculator solves for the remaining 2. 


Newton's Equations of Motion

These Kinematics equations relate an object's displacement, s, initial velocity u, final velocity v, acceleration a, and time t

1. $v = u + at$
2. $s = ut + 0.5*at^2$
3. $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$
